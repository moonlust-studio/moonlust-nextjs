<p>📖 <strong>Teaser</strong>: Not every embrace is about love. Some are just to keep a woman from falling apart.<br>💬 <strong>Tagline</strong>: Sometimes, the line we draw is the one we long to cross the most.</p>
<hr>
<p>The last message Ha Anh sent — &quot;I never forgot&quot; — had remained unanswered all night.<br>Until morning.<br><strong>[Quan:]</strong> &quot;If one day you want to forget the line... I’ll still be here. Just to listen. Just to hold you.&quot;<br>No other words.<br>That morning, Ha Anh stared at the message for a long time. She didn’t reply. But she didn’t delete it either.</p>
<hr>
<p>That afternoon, the sky turned grey, heavy with unnamed sadness. Wind rustled through the lakefront trees. Yellow leaves fell like quiet memories letting go.</p>
<p>She texted him one short line:<br><strong>[Ha Anh:]</strong> &quot;I need to talk. Can we meet?&quot;</p>
<p>They met at a lakeside café. Rain had started — a soft drizzle, like whispers from within.</p>
<p>Ha Anh arrived late. No makeup. A long knit dress, modest. But her eyes — they held a vast reservoir about to overflow.</p>
<p>She sat down. Didn’t order anything. Just said softly:<br>“That night… I was wrong. I shouldn’t have sent that.”</p>
<p>Quan stayed quiet. Looked at her for a long time, then shook his head gently:<br>“No. You weren’t wrong. You just… spoke your truth. And sometimes, speaking your truth… is the hardest thing of all.”</p>
<p>Rain grew heavier. Droplets streaked the window like memories sliding down glass.<br>“I’ll take you home,” he said, standing.</p>
<hr>
<p>On the road, rain pounded harder. At a long red light, the hum of traffic blurred into the sound of doubt.<br>Quan glanced at her and spoke, voice low, like wind slipping through a window:<br>“If you want… there’s a place nearby to wait out the rain. We could go there. Just until it eases.”</p>
<p>Ha Anh didn’t answer. She looked at the rain, at her hand gripping her purse strap. Then glanced at Quan.<br>Something cracked inside her.</p>
<p>She didn’t nod. Didn’t shake her head. Just turned away, whispering:<br>“…Yeah. It’s raining.”</p>
<hr>
<p>🌧️ A hotel. Warm lights. And the faint blur between boundaries.<br>The room was simple. Clean. Not luxurious. But quiet enough to hear a heartbeat.<br>Golden light filled the space, softening the walls — as reason began to surrender to feeling.</p>
<p>Ha Anh wrapped a towel loosely around herself after drying off. Quan leaned against the table, watching her. His gaze wasn’t teasing — it was ripe, restrained longing.<br>“This place… reminds me of my old apartment,” he murmured.</p>
<p>She blinked, startled by the memory.<br>“Back in college… cramped little room full of guitar strings and instant noodles.”<br>He stepped closer:<br>“You used to wear those oversized tees and shorts. Honestly… I found you even more attractive back then.”</p>
<p>She swatted his arm lightly, shy. But her eyes… shimmered with a quiet tremble.<br>“I remember that feeling. Just pulling you into my arms… made the whole world disappear.”</p>
<p>She turned away. Eyes toward the window. Then slowly stepped back, as if letting herself brush against the coming storm.</p>
<p>In her mind: <em>I’m married. I have a child. He’s just a ghost from the past. We’re here just to wait out the rain.</em><br>Lightning flashed. Thunder rolled — a voice from deep within.</p>
<p>Quan came closer. Placed his hand on her waist — gently, but firm, like instinct breaking free.<br>She gasped. Part of her wanted to push him away. Leave. Escape before this crossed beyond forgiveness.<br>But the memories… held her there.</p>
<p>He inhaled the scent of her damp hair. His breath seared her neck. His lips traced her spine — from nape to lower back.<br>His hand gripped her waist tighter — like he couldn’t bear to lose her again.</p>
<p>The wind blew the curtain open. Her towel shifted. And her body… shivered.</p>
<p>He turned her slowly to face him. Their eyes locked. A silence deeper than words.<br>He kissed her.<br>First, at the corner of her lips — soft as a dragonfly landing.<br>Then, deeper. Hungrier. Like years of restraint collapsing into a single kiss.</p>
<p>His hand brushed her shoulder. Fingers traced the edge of her towel. He paused — searching her eyes.<br>She didn’t speak. Just closed her eyes.</p>
<p>The towel slipped. Each inch, peeling away one last layer of self-defense.<br>His fingers caressed her skin — soft, untouched for too long.</p>
<p>He knelt. Lifted her heel. Kissed her knee. Then down her inner thigh — slow, deep, intoxicated.<br>She trembled.<br>“Quan… don’t look at me like that…” she whimpered, part ashamed, part aching.</p>
<p>Her phone buzzed. Her husband’s name lit up the screen.<br>She flinched. Turned away. But Quan stayed where he was — breath hot against her trembling thigh, like an electric current through her core.</p>
<p>She clutched the towel tighter, rushed to the window, answered.<br>Rain still fell outside. Inside, the golden light wrapped her flushed skin.<br>Thunder cracked. She shivered — not from fear, but from something deeper.</p>
<p>Her husband’s voice: “What are you doing? Home with our son?”<br>“Yeah… just watching TV.” Her voice shook, like someone caught between two waves.</p>
<p>But Quan was behind her now. His hand found her waist again — held tight.<br>His body pressed into her back — towel the only thing between them.<br>Below… something hard nudged against her.</p>
<p>She held her breath. Gripped the phone tighter.<br>“I’m here…” she whispered, dazed, clinging to the last thread of control.</p>
<p>His hand slid to her lower abdomen. Then paused. Waiting.<br>Her mind screamed. But her body… yearned.<br>If he didn’t stop now — she wouldn’t stop him.</p>
<p>Her husband said something. She didn’t hear.<br>A long silence.<br>Then she said:<br>“…Let’s talk later. I think our son’s calling.”</p>
<p>She ended the call.<br>And in that moment — every boundary collapsed.</p>
<p>She dropped the phone. Didn’t turn around. But didn’t stop him.<br>He understood.<br>He kissed her back. Her shoulder. Her neck.<br>And as his lips slid down her bare skin, Ha Anh closed her eyes — and let herself melt… into the rain… into the moment… with no way back.</p>

His lips traced her spine — from nape to lower back.\u003cbr\u003eHis hand gripped her waist tighter — like he couldn’t bear to lose her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind blew the curtain open. Her towel shifted. And her body… shivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned her slowly to face him. Their eyes locked. A silence deeper than words.\u003cbr\u003eHe kissed her.\u003cbr\u003eFirst, at the corner of her lips — soft as a dragonfly landing.\u003cbr\u003eThen, deeper. Hungrier. Like years of restraint collapsing into a single kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand brushed her shoulder. Fingers traced the edge of her towel. He paused — searching her eyes.\u003cbr\u003eShe didn’t speak. Just closed her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe towel slipped. Each inch, peeling away one last layer of self-defense.\u003cbr\u003eHis fingers caressed her skin — soft, untouched for too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knelt. Lifted her heel. Kissed her knee. Then down her inner thigh — slow, deep, intoxicated.\u003cbr\u003eShe trembled.\u003cbr\u003e“Quan… don’t look at me like that…” she whimpered, part ashamed, part aching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer phone buzzed. Her husband’s name lit up the screen.\u003cbr\u003eShe flinched. Turned away. But Quan stayed where he was — breath hot against her trembling thigh, like an electric current through her core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clutched the towel tighter, rushed to the window, answered.\u003cbr\u003eRain still fell outside. Inside, the golden light wrapped her flushed skin.\u003cbr\u003eThunder cracked. She shivered — not from fear, but from something deeper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer husband’s voice: “What are you doing? Home with our son?”\u003cbr\u003e“Yeah… just watching TV.” Her voice shook, like someone caught between two waves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Quan was behind her now. His hand found her waist again — held tight.\u003cbr\u003eHis body pressed into her back — towel the only thing between them.\u003cbr\u003eBelow… something hard nudged against her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held her breath. Gripped the phone tighter.\u003cbr\u003e“I’m here…” she whispered, dazed, clinging to the last thread of control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand slid to her lower abdomen. Then paused. Waiting.\u003cbr\u003eHer mind screamed. But her body… yearned.\u003cbr\u003eIf he didn’t stop now — she wouldn’t stop him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer husband said something. She didn’t hear.\u003cbr\u003eA long silence.\u003cbr\u003eThen she said:\u003cbr\u003e“…Let’s talk later. I think our son’s calling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ended the call.\u003cbr\u003eAnd in that moment — every boundary collapsed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dropped the phone. Didn’t turn around. But didn’t stop him.\u003cbr\u003eHe understood.\u003cbr\u003eHe kissed her back. Her shoulder. Her neck.\u003cbr\u003eAnd as his lips slid down her bare skin, Ha Anh closed her eyes — and let herself melt… into the rain… into the moment… with no way back.\u003c/p\u003e\n"},"chapterList":[{"id":1,"title":"Chapter 1: The Quiet Yearning","tag":""},{"id":2,"title":"Chapter 2: A Knock in the Dark","tag":""},{"id":3,"title":"Chapter 3: Scent of a Storm","tag":""},{"id":4,"title":"Chapter 4: Between the Drops","tag":""},{"id":5,"title":"Chapter 5: Glasses of Longing","tag":""},{"id":6,"title":"Chapter 6: From a Single Touch","tag":""},{"id":7,"title":"Chapter 7: When the Body Speaks","tag":""},{"id":8,"title":"Chapter 8: Sleepless Night","tag":""},{"id":9,"title":"Chapter 9: A New Flavor of Temptation","tag":""},{"id":10,"title":"Chapter 10: Everything That Trembled Inside Her","tag":""},{"id":11,"title":"Chapter 11: The Day He Returned","tag":""},{"id":12,"title":"Chapter 12: In His Arms, Yet Out of Rhythm","tag":""},{"id":13,"title":"Chapter 13: The Final Offering","tag":""}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/truyen/[slug]/chapters/[id]","query":{"slug":"vang-chong","id":"6"},"buildId":"BHHjcyuIejARxTmiQAnNt","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"locale":"en","locales":["vi","en","ja"],"defaultLocale":"vi","scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
