The eyes, the voice, the quiet tension — all come rushing back with just one message. And as rain falls outside her window, a long-forgotten part of her stirs awake. Maybe it was never really gone.</p>\n\n<p>“Have you ever wondered... if a part of me was still waiting for you?”\nThe thought drifted through Hà Anh’s mind like breath across warm tea — soft, fleeting, gone before it could linger.</p>\n<p>Quân.</p>\n<p>His name echoed like a note from a song she hadn’t heard in years — low, familiar, buried under time, now quietly vibrating in her chest.</p>\n<p>It felt strange. Not frightening — but like an old breeze finding the back of your neck, reminding you how it once knew your skin by heart.</p>\n<p>He looked the same. Tall. Lean. A face marked not by age, but by the pause of time.</p>\n<p>But his eyes... they hadn’t changed. Still deep. Still soft enough to make you look away — not from discomfort, but to avoid falling into the ache of remembering.</p>\n<p>She took a step back, fingers tightening around her purse strap — not from fear, but instinct. Like anchoring herself inside a moment too wide, too still.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a while,” he said — voice husky, low, laced with that casual intimacy of someone who once lived inside your silence.</p>\n<p>She nodded. A careful smile. Shy. Tilted. Like something once precious, now too delicate to hold.</p>\n<p>They had loved each other.</p>\n<p>The kind of love that blooms before the world gets too loud. Raw. Hopeful. Reckless in its honesty.</p>\n<p>But love didn’t pay rent. Didn’t impress parents.</p>\n<p>Her mother had said, “You can’t live off love. My daughter needs something real.”</p>\n<p>And Quân had nothing — except a tender voice and a heart too wide.</p>\n<p>He never blamed her. Only himself — for not having more to offer.</p>\n<p>And Hà Anh — though she ached — let go.</p>\n<p>Not because she wanted to. But because she was taught to.</p>\n<p>They didn’t fall out of love. They just ran out of the time they were allowed to stay in it.</p>\n<p>The day they graduated, he disappeared. No goodbye. No message. And she never chased him.</p>\n<p>Because deep down, she knew: if they ever saw each other again, she wouldn’t leave him twice.</p>\n<p>She thought that chapter had closed.</p>\n<p>Until that night — under the neon lights of a supermarket, between the rustling of greens and polished tiles — their eyes met.</p>\n<p>And it all came back. Like wind slamming into a half-open window.</p>\n<p>Not love. Not regret.</p>\n<p>But the ache of something unfinished. A pull between memory and instinct.</p>\n<p>“I just moved in,” he said. “Two buildings down.”</p>\n<p>His gaze didn’t leave hers.</p>\n<p>She smiled — the kind that hides a stuttered heartbeat. Then turned away. Gracefully. Like nothing had happened.</p>\n<p>But his gaze… lingered.</p>\n<p>That night, she curled under the covers. The bedside lamp spilled gold across her shoulder — skin soft as rain-warmed silk.</p>\n"},"chapterList":[{"id":1,"title":"Chapter 1: The Quiet Yearning","tag":""},{"id":2,"title":"Chapter 2: A Knock in the Dark","tag":""},{"id":3,"title":"Chapter 3: Scent of a Storm","tag":""},{"id":4,"title":"Chapter 4: Between the Drops","tag":""},{"id":5,"title":"Chapter 5: Glasses of Longing","tag":""},{"id":6,"title":"Chapter 6: From a Single Touch","tag":""},{"id":7,"title":"Chapter 7: When the Body Speaks","tag":""},{"id":8,"title":"Chapter 8: Sleepless Night","tag":""},{"id":9,"title":"Chapter 9: A New Flavor of Temptation","tag":""},{"id":10,"title":"Chapter 10: Everything That Trembled Inside Her","tag":""},{"id":11,"title":"Chapter 11: The Day He Returned","tag":""},{"id":12,"title":"Chapter 12: In His Arms, Yet Out of Rhythm","tag":""},{"id":13,"title":"Chapter 13: The Final Offering","tag":""}]},"__N_SSG":true}
