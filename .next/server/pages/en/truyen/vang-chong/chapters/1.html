Evening sunlight spilled across the tiles, casting a tired golden hue on the pale walls. She slipped off her shoes, hung up her coat, and slowly collapsed onto the sofa with a long, weary sigh — as if trying to shed the invisible weight she’d been carrying all day.</p>
<p>The clock struck six. Silence — the same kind she came home to every night — settled over the room.</p>
<p>Her husband had been working overseas for almost two years. The video calls had grown infrequent. The messages? Just a few clipped words: “Busy.” “In a meeting.” “Will call when I can.”</p>
<p>At first, she told herself it was temporary — for their future, their family, their dreams.</p>
<p>But the emptiness had a quiet way of creeping in — during meals eaten alone, on sleepless nights staring at the ceiling, in the cold space beside her in bed.</p>
<p>She didn’t complain. Didn’t blame him. She did everything right — went to work, picked up her son, called her mother-in-law, kept the house in order.</p>
<p>But some nights, her own reflection startled her. The sparkle in her eyes was gone. The smile felt... practiced. Something inside her had quietly slipped away — like a single strand of hair falling without a sound.</p>
<p>That night, after dinner, she made herself a cup of tea. She sat by the window, watching city lights flicker in the distance. The world was still alive. Still rushing. Still bright. But inside her, everything felt muted — like a song without lyrics drifting through the dark.</p>
<p>Her phone lit up. Not him. Just an ad. She set it down. Closed her eyes.</p>
<p>A hush rose in her chest — soft, like a rising tide — but strong enough to make her heart flutter.</p>
<p>And then, uninvited but unmistakable, a name surfaced — distant, delicate, almost dreamlike — but enough to make her chest tighten with something she hadn’t felt in a very long time.</p>
<p>Just then, the doorbell rang.</p>
<p>She froze.</p>
<p>Standing on the other side was her neighbor — holding a small box of pastries…</p>
