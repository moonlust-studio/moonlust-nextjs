love H√† Anh thought she had buried. The eyes, the voice, the quiet tension ‚Äî all come rushing back with just one message. And as rain falls outside her window, a long-forgotten part of her stirs awake. Maybe it was never really gone.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHave you ever wondered... if a part of me was still waiting for you?‚Äù
The thought drifted through H√† Anh‚Äôs mind like breath across warm tea ‚Äî soft, fleeting, gone before it could linger.</p>
<p>Qu√¢n.</p>
<p>His name echoed like a note from a song she hadn‚Äôt heard in years ‚Äî low, familiar, buried under time, now quietly vibrating in her chest.</p>
<p>It felt strange. Not frightening ‚Äî but like an old breeze finding the back of your neck, reminding you how it once knew your skin by heart.</p>
<p>He looked the same. Tall. Lean. A face marked not by age, but by the pause of time.</p>
<p>But his eyes... they hadn‚Äôt changed. Still deep. Still soft enough to make you look away ‚Äî not from discomfort, but to avoid falling into the ache of remembering.</p>
<p>She took a step back, fingers tightening around her purse strap ‚Äî not from fear, but instinct. Like anchoring herself inside a moment too wide, too still.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a while,‚Äù he said ‚Äî voice husky, low, laced with that casual intimacy of someone who once lived inside your silence.</p>
<p>She nodded. A careful smile. Shy. Tilted. Like something once precious, now too delicate to hold.</p>
<p>They had loved each other.</p>
<p>The kind of love that blooms before the world gets too loud. Raw. Hopeful. Reckless in its honesty.</p>
<p>But love didn‚Äôt pay rent. Didn‚Äôt impress parents.</p>
<p>Her mother had said, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt live off love. My daughter needs something real.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Qu√¢n had nothing ‚Äî except a tender voice and a heart too wide.</p>
<p>He never blamed her. Only himself ‚Äî for not having more to offer.</p>
<p>And H√† Anh ‚Äî though she ached ‚Äî let go.</p>
<p>Not because she wanted to. But because she was taught to.</p>
<p>They didn‚Äôt fall out of love. They just ran out of the time they were allowed to stay in it.</p>
<p>The day they graduated, he disappeared. No goodbye. No message. And she never chased him.</p>
<p>Because deep down, she knew: if they ever saw each other again, she wouldn‚Äôt leave him twice.</p>
<p>She thought that chapter had closed.</p>
<p>Until that night ‚Äî under the neon lights of a supermarket, between the rustling of greens and polished tiles ‚Äî their eyes met.</p>
<p>And it all came back. Like wind slamming into a half-open window.</p>
<p>Not love. Not regret.</p>
<p>But the ache of something unfinished. A pull between memory and instinct.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI just moved in,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTwo buildings down.‚Äù</p>
<p>His gaze didn‚Äôt leave hers.</p>
<p>She smiled ‚Äî the kind that hides a stuttered heartbeat. Then turned away. Gracefully. Like nothing had happened.</p>
<p>But his gaze‚Ä¶ lingered.</p>
<p>That night, she curled under the covers. The bedside lamp spilled gold across her shoulder ‚Äî skin soft as rain-warmed silk.</p>
