Just a look, a touch... and the body will answer on its own.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The phone had just gone silent, and Ha Anh stood frozen — both hands gripping the window ledge, her body locked between a tide of memories and the storm of longing rising inside her.</p>\n<p>Outside, the wind lashed against the glass, syncing with her pounding heartbeat, threatening to explode.</p>\n<p>Behind her, Quan said nothing. He simply tightened his arms around her waist — steady, warm. No demands. No rush. But no retreat either.</p>\n<p>Ha Anh tilted her head slightly. His lips found her ear, whispering with hot, damp breath:<br>&quot;I&#39;m here. You don’t need to say a thing...&quot;</p>\n<p>Then he kissed her. No longer tentative — but with fire. From her neck, across her shoulder, down to the trembling curve of her collarbone.<br>Wherever his lips touched, her skin awoke like after a long sleep.</p>\n<p>Ha Anh turned to face him. Her eyes glassy. She looked up at him — no longer resisting, but surrendering. A surrender both proud and desperate.</p>\n<p>She kissed him. Her lips reached for his — hungry, trembling, like a child returning to a long-lost embrace.<br>Their kiss deepened — fierce, uninterrupted, as if stopping would shatter it all.</p>\n<p>Quan lifted her. Ha Anh wrapped her arms around his neck, burying her face into the hollow of his shoulder — where his scent lingered like an addictive drug.</p>\n<p>He laid her on the bed — as gently as placing something sacred on the altar of desire.<br>Her towel slipped away. Her naked body revealed beneath the soft, golden light. She moved to cover her chest, but Quan stopped her.</p>\n<p>He looked at her for a long time — said nothing, just placed a hand on her left breast, over her racing heart:<br>&quot;Right here… you&#39;re still the same girl I once loved.&quot;</p>\n<p>Then he lowered his head. His mouth wrapped around her soft breast. His tongue circled her stiffening nipple — tender yet intense.<br>Ha Anh arched. A gasp escaped her lips — involuntary, raw.</p>\n<p>He took his time. His left hand traced her spine — from the nape to her lower back, each vertebra shivering.<br>His right hand slipped lower — across her belly, past her navel, and paused at the warm, wet triangle of her desire.</p>\n<p>He didn’t enter. Just traced the outer folds with one finger — like a wind dancing over water and fire.<br>She twitched slightly, but didn’t resist. Her legs parted. Her body responded like a night flower blooming under a summer rain.</p>\n<p>Outside, a low rumble of thunder echoed — awakening something primal in her.</p>\n<p>As his finger slid inside, she arched, moaning:<br>&quot;Ah... don&#39;t... don’t be rough...&quot;<br>But her eyes begged: <em>Don’t stop...</em></p>\n<p>Quan continued — gentle at first, then firmer. Ha Anh clutched the bedsheet, trembling.<br>One hand still caressed her breast, the other played with her drenched petals.<br>She heard her own heartbeat — erratic, wild — mingling with the steady patter of rain on glass.</p>\n<p>Then he spread her legs wider, sliding between them. His erection was hard as stone, burning like fire.<br>When its tip touched her wet entrance, Ha Anh jerked — but didn’t pull away. She only whispered:<br>&quot;Quan… go slow…&quot;</p>\n<p>He looked at her, said nothing, kissed her forehead — then pushed in gently.</p>\n<p>As he entered her, a flicker of memory surfaced — her husband’s brief, silent sessions. No kisses. No foreplay. No whispers. Just duty.<br>But now... Quan was inside her — with heart, with eyes, with every tender thrust.</p>\n<p>The fullness wasn’t just physical — it was the overwhelming presence of a real man.<br>She shuddered — not in pain, but because for the first time… she felt like a woman.<br>For the first time in years of a cold marriage — she felt someone truly entering her.</p>\n<p>Full. Overwhelmed. Yet... something hollow deep within finally felt complete.<br>Every movement erased the nights she lay alone. Slow at first, then building — until the old bed creaked with each rhythm.</p>\n<p>The wind still howled. Rain still fell. And they — tangled together like two souls meeting in a storm.<br>Ha Anh moaned — soft at first, then louder, unashamed.<br>She called his name. Clung to him. Cried.</p>\n<p>But not from guilt — from the release of finally being heard.<br>&quot;Just like that... don’t let me go...&quot; — she sobbed between thrusts — both in pain and in ecstasy.</p>\n<p>Quan didn’t answer. He just held her tighter — as if melting into her, piece by piece.</p>\n<p>And then, at the deepest point — as her body clenched around him, a broken moan on her lips —<br>Quan exhaled, thrust one final time... and stopped, his body trembling.</p>\n<p>A hot rush spilled inside her.<br>Ha Anh’s eyes widened — her whole body lit up, confused, lost, yet wrapped in a strange fullness.</p>\n<p>She could hear it — the pulsing deep within, the warmest part of her just filled.</p>\n<p>Neither spoke. Only breath tangled. Rain whispered beyond the glass.<br>And here — in this small room — two souls had touched something far beyond flesh.</p>\n<p>...She didn’t know how long the night would last.<br>But she knew — she would never be the same again.</p>\n"},"chapterList":[{"id":1,"title":"Chapter 1: The Quiet Yearning","tag":""},{"id":2,"title":"Chapter 2: A Knock in the Dark","tag":""},{"id":3,"title":"Chapter 3: Scent of a Storm","tag":""},{"id":4,"title":"Chapter 4: Between the Drops","tag":""},{"id":5,"title":"Chapter 5: Glasses of Longing","tag":""},{"id":6,"title":"Chapter 6: From a Single Touch","tag":""},{"id":7,"title":"Chapter 7: When the Body Speaks","tag":""},{"id":8,"title":"Chapter 8: Sleepless Night","tag":""},{"id":9,"title":"Chapter 9: A New Flavor of Temptation","tag":""},{"id":10,"title":"Chapter 10: Everything That Trembled Inside Her","tag":""},{"id":11,"title":"Chapter 11: The Day He Returned","tag":""},{"id":12,"title":"Chapter 12: In His Arms, Yet Out of Rhythm","tag":""},{"id":13,"title":"Chapter 13: The Final Offering","tag":""}]},"__N_SSG":true}
