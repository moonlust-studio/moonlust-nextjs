Some are just to keep a woman from falling apart.<br>💬 <strong>Tagline</strong>: Sometimes, the line we draw is the one we long to cross the most.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The last message Ha Anh sent — &quot;I never forgot&quot; — had remained unanswered all night.<br>Until morning.<br><strong>[Quan:]</strong> &quot;If one day you want to forget the line... I’ll still be here. Just to listen. Just to hold you.&quot;<br>No other words.<br>That morning, Ha Anh stared at the message for a long time. She didn’t reply. But she didn’t delete it either.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>That afternoon, the sky turned grey, heavy with unnamed sadness. Wind rustled through the lakefront trees. Yellow leaves fell like quiet memories letting go.</p>\n<p>She texted him one short line:<br><strong>[Ha Anh:]</strong> &quot;I need to talk. Can we meet?&quot;</p>\n<p>They met at a lakeside café. Rain had started — a soft drizzle, like whispers from within.</p>\n<p>Ha Anh arrived late. No makeup. A long knit dress, modest. But her eyes — they held a vast reservoir about to overflow.</p>\n<p>She sat down. Didn’t order anything. Just said softly:<br>“That night… I was wrong. I shouldn’t have sent that.”</p>\n<p>Quan stayed quiet. Looked at her for a long time, then shook his head gently:<br>“No. You weren’t wrong. You just… spoke your truth. And sometimes, speaking your truth… is the hardest thing of all.”</p>\n<p>Rain grew heavier. Droplets streaked the window like memories sliding down glass.<br>“I’ll take you home,” he said, standing.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>On the road, rain pounded harder. At a long red light, the hum of traffic blurred into the sound of doubt.<br>Quan glanced at her and spoke, voice low, like wind slipping through a window:<br>“If you want… there’s a place nearby to wait out the rain. We could go there. Just until it eases.”</p>\n<p>Ha Anh didn’t answer. She looked at the rain, at her hand gripping her purse strap. Then glanced at Quan.<br>Something cracked inside her.</p>\n<p>She didn’t nod. Didn’t shake her head. Just turned away, whispering:<br>“…Yeah. It’s raining.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>🌧️ A hotel. Warm lights. And the faint blur between boundaries.<br>The room was simple. Clean. Not luxurious. But quiet enough to hear a heartbeat.<br>Golden light filled the space, softening the walls — as reason began to surrender to feeling.</p>\n<p>Ha Anh wrapped a towel loosely around herself after drying off. Quan leaned against the table, watching her. His gaze wasn’t teasing — it was ripe, restrained longing.<br>“This place… reminds me of my old apartment,” he murmured.</p>\n<p>She blinked, startled by the memory.<br>“Back in college… cramped little room full of guitar strings and instant noodles.”<br>He stepped closer:<br>“You used to wear those oversized tees and shorts. Honestly… I found you even more attractive back then.”</p>\n<p>She swatted his arm lightly, shy. But her eyes… shimmered with a quiet tremble.<br>“I remember that feeling. Just pulling you into my arms… made the whole world disappear.”</p>\n<p>She turned away. Eyes toward the window. Then slowly stepped back, as if letting herself brush against the coming storm.</p>\n<p>In her mind: <em>I’m married. I have a child. He’s just a ghost from the past. We’re here just to wait out the rain.</em><br>Lightning flashed. Thunder rolled — a voice from deep within.</p>\n<p>Quan came closer. Placed his hand on her waist — gently, but firm, like instinct breaking free.<br>She gasped. Part of her wanted to push him away. Leave. Escape before this crossed beyond forgiveness.<br>But the memories… held her there.</p>\n<p>He inhaled the scent of her damp hair. His breath seared her neck. His lips traced her spine — from nape to lower back.<br>His hand gripped her waist tighter — like he couldn’t bear to lose her again.</p>\n<p>The wind blew the curtain open. Her towel shifted. And her body… shivered.</p>\n<p>He turned her slowly to face him. Their eyes locked. A silence deeper than words.<br>He kissed her.<br>First, at the corner of her lips — soft as a dragonfly landing.<br>Then, deeper. Hungrier. Like years of restraint collapsing into a single kiss.</p>\n<p>His hand brushed her shoulder. Fingers traced the edge of her towel. He paused — searching her eyes.<br>She didn’t speak. Just closed her eyes.</p>\n<p>The towel slipped. Each inch, peeling away one last layer of self-defense.<br>His fingers caressed her skin — soft, untouched for too long.</p>\n<p>He knelt. Lifted her heel. Kissed her knee. Then down her inner thigh — slow, deep, intoxicated.<br>She trembled.<br>“Quan… don’t look at me like that…” she whimpered, part ashamed, part aching.</p>\n<p>Her phone buzzed. Her husband’s name lit up the screen.<br>She flinched. Turned away. But Quan stayed where he was — breath hot against her trembling thigh, like an electric current through her core.</p>\n<p>She clutched the towel tighter, rushed to the window, answered.<br>Rain still fell outside. Inside, the golden light wrapped her flushed skin.<br>Thunder cracked. She shivered — not from fear, but from something deeper.</p>\n<p>Her husband’s voice: “What are you doing? Home with our son?”<br>“Yeah… just watching TV.” Her voice shook, like someone caught between two waves.</p>\n<p>But Quan was behind her now. His hand found her waist again — held tight.<br>His body pressed into her back — towel the only thing between them.<br>Below… something hard nudged against her.</p>\n<p>She held her breath. Gripped the phone tighter.<br>“I’m here…” she whispered, dazed, clinging to the last thread of control.</p>\n<p>His hand slid to her lower abdomen. Then paused. Waiting.<br>Her mind screamed. But her body… yearned.<br>If he didn’t stop now — she wouldn’t stop him.</p>\n<p>Her husband said something. She didn’t hear.<br>A long silence.<br>Then she said:<br>“…Let’s talk later. I think our son’s calling.”</p>\n<p>She ended the call.<br>And in that moment — every boundary collapsed.</p>\n<p>She dropped the phone. Didn’t turn around. But didn’t stop him.<br>He understood.<br>He kissed her back. Her shoulder. Her neck.<br>And as his lips slid down her bare skin, Ha Anh closed her eyes — and let herself melt… into the rain… into the moment… with no way back.</p>\n"},"chapterList":[{"id":1,"title":"Chapter 1: The Quiet Yearning","tag":""},{"id":2,"title":"Chapter 2: A Knock in the Dark","tag":""},{"id":3,"title":"Chapter 3: Scent of a Storm","tag":""},{"id":4,"title":"Chapter 4: Between the Drops","tag":""},{"id":5,"title":"Chapter 5: Glasses of Longing","tag":""},{"id":6,"title":"Chapter 6: From a Single Touch","tag":""},{"id":7,"title":"Chapter 7: When the Body Speaks","tag":""},{"id":8,"title":"Chapter 8: Sleepless Night","tag":""},{"id":9,"title":"Chapter 9: A New Flavor of Temptation","tag":""},{"id":10,"title":"Chapter 10: Everything That Trembled Inside Her","tag":""},{"id":11,"title":"Chapter 11: The Day He Returned","tag":""},{"id":12,"title":"Chapter 12: In His Arms, Yet Out of Rhythm","tag":""},{"id":13,"title":"Chapter 13: The Final Offering","tag":""}]},"__N_SSG":true}
