<p><strong>📖 Teaser:</strong> A chance encounter at the supermarket reawakens a love Hà Anh thought she had buried. The eyes, the voice, the quiet tension — all come rushing back with just one message. And as rain falls outside her window, a long-forgotten part of her stirs awake. Maybe it was never really gone.</p>

“Have you ever wondered... if a part of me was still waiting for you?”
The thought drifted through Hà Anh’s mind like breath across warm tea — soft, fleeting, gone before it could linger.

Quân.

His name echoed like a note from a song she hadn’t heard in years — low, familiar, buried under time, now quietly vibrating in her chest.

It felt strange. Not frightening — but like an old breeze finding the back of your neck, reminding you how it once knew your skin by heart.

He looked the same. Tall. Lean. A face marked not by age, but by the pause of time.

But his eyes... they hadn’t changed. Still deep. Still soft enough to make you look away — not from discomfort, but to avoid falling into the ache of remembering.

She took a step back, fingers tightening around her purse strap — not from fear, but instinct. Like anchoring herself inside a moment too wide, too still.

“It’s been a while,” he said — voice husky, low, laced with that casual intimacy of someone who once lived inside your silence.

She nodded. A careful smile. Shy. Tilted. Like something once precious, now too delicate to hold.

They had loved each other.

The kind of love that blooms before the world gets too loud. Raw. Hopeful. Reckless in its honesty.

But love didn’t pay rent. Didn’t impress parents.

Her mother had said, “You can’t live off love. My daughter needs something real.”

And Quân had nothing — except a tender voice and a heart too wide.

He never blamed her. Only himself — for not having more to offer.

And Hà Anh — though she ached — let go.

Not because she wanted to. But because she was taught to.

They didn’t fall out of love. They just ran out of the time they were allowed to stay in it.

The day they graduated, he disappeared. No goodbye. No message. And she never chased him.

Because deep down, she knew: if they ever saw each other again, she wouldn’t leave him twice.

She thought that chapter had closed.

Until that night — under the neon lights of a supermarket, between the rustling of greens and polished tiles — their eyes met.

And it all came back. Like wind slamming into a half-open window.

Not love. Not regret.

But the ache of something unfinished. A pull between memory and instinct.

“I just moved in,” he said. “Two buildings down.”

His gaze didn’t leave hers.

She smiled — the kind that hides a stuttered heartbeat. Then turned away. Gracefully. Like nothing had happened.

But his gaze… lingered.

That night, she curled under the covers. The bedside lamp spilled gold across her shoulder — skin soft as rain-warmed silk.
