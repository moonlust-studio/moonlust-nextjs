Some come from memories that never learned how to fade.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The old seafood shack still sat beneath the canopy of that ancient almond tree, its yellow lights casting a hazy glow over steaming trays of boiled snails, stir-fried clams, grilled scallops. The scent of alcohol mingled with lemongrass, ginger, and sea salt — a small gateway to a long-sleeping memory.</p>\n<p>Quan arrived first. Sleeves rolled, hair tousled like the old days. He was staring into his glass of rice wine when her silhouette appeared.</p>\n<p>Ha Anh came later. An ivory silk dress hugged her frame — not revealing, but enough to highlight the curves of a woman seasoned by life. Her body had changed in the way mothers do. The flat stomach of her youth now gave way to soft, full femininity — a kind of ripeness that made every movement seem like a sensual note in a song.</p>\n<p>Her wavy hair cascaded loosely. Bare shoulders peeked through the thin silk. Her eyes — still those same eyes — deep, wistful, like a lake in late autumn.</p>\n<p>Quan looked up. Froze for a second. Not because she looked glamorous, but because of that ripened womanhood — the kind of beauty only time can shape, and only the observant can truly feel.</p>\n<p>&quot;Been a while since I had this dish,&quot; she said, picking up a steaming snail.</p>\n<p>&quot;Tastes the same. But the person next to me… isn’t the third-year student from back then.&quot; He smiled, pouring her a splash of rice wine.</p>\n<p>She hesitated, then raised her glass for a light clink. “Just one glass.”</p>\n<p>But one became two, then three. Not out of a wish to get drunk — but as a shield, a reason not to speak the truth.</p>\n<p>The restaurant lights blurred with the wine. Laughter from other tables faded, leaving only the rustling leaves above and the soft crackle of charcoal below.</p>\n<p>Quan poured more wine, his voice low, almost like he was talking to himself:</p>\n<p>&quot;It’s been ages since I sat like this… next to someone who once made me forget the world.&quot;</p>\n<p>Ha Anh chuckled softly, eyes lowered, fingers swirling her glass. She didn’t answer, but the corners of her lips moved slightly.</p>\n<p>He looked at her, slow and deliberate:</p>\n<p>“Do you remember that rainy afternoon? We were holed up in my little room — cold outside, but burning up inside.”</p>\n<p>She froze. A pang hit her heart.</p>\n<p>&quot;I remember. Vividly,&quot; she whispered.</p>\n<p>A long pause. Quan sipped his wine, gently set the glass down, his fingers brushing the edge of the table.</p>\n<p>&quot;If there hadn’t been footsteps in the hallway that day… we might not have stopped.&quot;</p>\n<p>She looked at him — eyes shimmering with something between longing and regret.</p>\n<p>She hadn’t thought he remembered… those tiny details. What she’d locked away and tried to forget still lived, perfectly preserved, in someone else.</p>\n<p>And that… made her heart ache.</p>\n<p>“Maybe… back then, I wasn’t brave enough. I thought drawing a line would keep you close. But all I kept… was a beautiful memory I can’t touch.”</p>\n<p>She put down her chopsticks.</p>\n<p>&quot;My husband’s been on an overseas assignment for over a year now.&quot;</p>\n<p>“I know.”</p>\n<p>“At first, we’d video call every day. Then it faded… now it’s just short messages like ‘Work’s hectic. Take care.’”</p>\n<p>Her voice carried no blame — just fact, wrapped in a paper-thin smile that the wind could blow away.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes I don’t miss him… as much as I miss the feeling of someone looking me in the eyes and seeing me.”</p>\n<p>That line — like a blade slicing through the emotional armor she’d been wearing.</p>\n<p>Quan said nothing. Just poured another glass and handed it to her. Their hands touched.</p>\n<p>She paused.</p>\n<p>Didn’t pull back.</p>\n<p>Didn’t flinch.</p>\n<p>The wine. The warmth. His gaze… made her heart skip a beat.</p>\n<p>They kept talking. About college. Skipping class to eat snails. The first time he held her hand in the rain — shaking like a boy in love for the first time.</p>\n<p>Fragments of old stories — soaked in nostalgia, in longing, in desires that had never quite found names.</p>\n<p>Night settled in. The wine warmed her cheeks. She tilted her head back for a final sip, wincing at the burn — eyes glistening like dew.</p>\n<p>“I should go,” she said, tightening the strap of her purse.</p>\n<p>“I’ll call a cab.”</p>\n<p>When it arrived, Quan draped his coat over her shoulders. His hand lingered at the nape of her neck — a beat too long. She closed her eyes for a second. Didn’t move.</p>\n<p>As she stepped into the car, she turned and whispered:</p>\n<p>“Thank you… for tonight.”</p>\n<p>He leaned in, kissed her cheek — light, without desire. Just a touch, like he didn’t want the night to end with words.</p>\n<p>She didn’t resist. But didn’t return it either.</p>\n<p>Only her eyes — as she turned away — glistened just a bit more.</p>\n<p>The car pulled away. She leaned against the window, thoughts tangled.</p>\n<p><strong>[Text from Quan:]</strong> “I still remember… that rainy night. You were curled up under the blanket, wet hair clinging to your cheek. That look in your eyes… it was the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen.”</p>\n<p>She stared at the screen. Hesitated. Then typed:</p>\n<p><strong>[Reply:]</strong> “Tonight… I don’t know if I should feel happy or sad. But one thing I’m sure of: I never forgot.”</p>\n"},"chapterList":[{"id":1,"title":"Chapter 1: The Quiet Yearning","tag":""},{"id":2,"title":"Chapter 2: A Knock in the Dark","tag":""},{"id":3,"title":"Chapter 3: Scent of a Storm","tag":""},{"id":4,"title":"Chapter 4: Between the Drops","tag":""},{"id":5,"title":"Chapter 5: Glasses of Longing","tag":""},{"id":6,"title":"Chapter 6: From a Single Touch","tag":""},{"id":7,"title":"Chapter 7: When the Body Speaks","tag":""},{"id":8,"title":"Chapter 8: Sleepless Night","tag":""},{"id":9,"title":"Chapter 9: A New Flavor of Temptation","tag":""},{"id":10,"title":"Chapter 10: Everything That Trembled Inside Her","tag":""},{"id":11,"title":"Chapter 11: The Day He Returned","tag":""},{"id":12,"title":"Chapter 12: In His Arms, Yet Out of Rhythm","tag":""},{"id":13,"title":"Chapter 13: The Final Offering","tag":""}]},"__N_SSG":true}
