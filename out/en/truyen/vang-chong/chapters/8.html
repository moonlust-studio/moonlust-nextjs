<p>üìñ <strong>Teaser:</strong> When the body speaks, the soul can no longer remain silent.<br>üéß <strong>Tagline:</strong> Lust is loudest when whispered through the skin.</p>
<hr>
<p>Ha Anh lay on her side, her messy hair spilling down her bare back. The warm yellow light of the bedside lamp cast a glow over her flushed skin, still steeped in the breath of passion.</p>
<p>Quan was behind her, his arm wrapped securely around her waist. His breathing was deep and even‚Äîbut his eyes remained open, as if trying to memorize each trembling moment just passed.</p>
<p>She wasn‚Äôt asleep. Her body was still tingling, but inside‚Ä¶ it felt like a flood was rising‚Äîwild and unstoppable.</p>
<p>Her hand reached back, touching his. Then she turned her head, a tiny, mischievous smile tugging at her lips:</p>
<p>&quot;Do you want more?&quot;</p>
<p>Quan looked at her. No words. But his eyes‚Äîlit up like fire.</p>
<p>He rolled her onto her back, leaning down to kiss her breast that had only just calmed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou already know the answer.‚Äù</p>
<p>This time, it was Ha Anh who took the lead. She wrapped her legs around his waist, pulling him close. Her hand reached down, grasping his hardness‚Äîwarm, full, pulsing‚Äîand guided it to her lips.</p>
<p>She kissed the tip as if caressing something sacred. Her tongue traced his length, her eyes locked on his‚Äîteasing, seductive.</p>
<p>Quan let out a low moan, his body taut. He gripped the sheet as her tongue played around the vein that ran beneath, then slowly, gradually, took him into her mouth‚Äîdeeper, deeper‚Äîuntil she reached the base.</p>
<p>&quot;Where did you learn this...?‚Äù he whispered, gasping and moaning.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNot from my husband,‚Äù she smirked‚Äîhalf teasing, half true‚Äîthen continued, taking him in again, slower this time, in a rhythm soft and hypnotic, like a lullaby for lust.</p>
<p>Wet sounds filled the quiet room. Moans mingled with suckling, breath hot and heavy.</p>
<p>Just when Quan thought he might lose control, she stopped‚Äîclimbed on top of him, pinned his hands above his head, and slid down.</p>
<p>As he entered from below, she let out a shuddering moan of fulfillment:</p>
<p>‚ÄúAh‚Ä¶ god‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so deep‚Ä¶ I love it‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>She began to move‚Äîslow at first, then faster. Her breasts bounced with each thrust. Sweat glistened on her neck, chest, stomach‚Äîthe light catching her like a glowing silhouette in the dark.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy husband‚Äôs never seen me like this‚Ä¶‚Äù she hissed, then leaned down and bit his ear. ‚ÄúDo you know‚Ä¶ how long I‚Äôve craved this feeling?‚Äù</p>
<p>Quan flipped her over, lifted her legs onto his shoulders‚Äîand pounded. Hard. Relentless.</p>
<p>The wet slaps echoed, blending with panting breaths and Ha Anh‚Äôs sobbing moans:</p>
<p>&quot;So deep‚Ä¶ ah‚Ä¶ yes‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt stop‚Ä¶ more‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>They changed positions again and again‚Äîshe on all fours, he taking her from behind; then lying sideways, one leg lifted for deeper thrusts; then she sat on him in a chair, arms wrapped around his neck‚Äîher back arched, chest pressed against his, their bodies moving in perfect rhythm.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRight there‚Ä¶ yes‚Ä¶ harder‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt you dare go easy on me tonight‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>Each climax brought tears‚Äîof not pain, but release. A wave of ecstasy stripping away her every facade.</p>
<p>No longer the cold wife. No longer the perfect mother. Just a woman‚Äîaching to be seen, to be touched, to melt in the arms of someone who truly listened to her body.</p>
<p>‚ÄúQuan‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ again‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt stop‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMoan for me, Ha Anh‚Ä¶ let me hear everything you‚Äôve kept buried‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>That night, they made love a third time, a fourth‚Ä¶ they stopped counting. She drifted off, only to be awakened again by a kiss between her thighs.</p>
<p>She smiled through her tears. Moaned his name. And as dawn crept in, with the storm outside finally quieting‚Ä¶ they were still tangled in each other.</p>
<p>Before the final round, Ha Anh leaned in, whispering into his ear with a trembling but eager voice:</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis time‚Ä¶ I want it‚Ä¶ in my mouth. Let me taste you‚Ä¶ please.‚Äù</p>
<p>The words incinerated whatever reason Quan had left.</p>
<p>He panted, lifted himself, letting her lie back with her head slightly raised.</p>
<p>Standing by the bed, he watched as Ha Anh opened her lips‚Äîeyes gleaming, tongue tracing around his swollen tip‚Äîthen took him in.</p>
<p>Quan grabbed her hair, moaning out loud:</p>
<p>&quot;God‚Ä¶ Ha Anh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve dreamed of this since college‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>She sucked deeply, rhythmically‚Äîsaliva and heat combining into wet, obscene music.</p>
<p>She reached up, using both hands and lips, making his whole body tense, every vein prominent.</p>
<p>Her soft moans hummed through him‚Äîlike a desperate, rising melody.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMore‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt hold it‚Ä¶ ah‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
<p>And then‚Äîwith a guttural moan and a strained cry of her name‚ÄîQuan convulsed, holding her head in place‚Ä¶ and came.</p>
<p>Pulse after pulse of thick heat filled her mouth, coated her tongue, slipped down her throat.</p>
<p>Ha Anh didn‚Äôt flinch. She swallowed‚Äîslowly, fully‚Äîthen exhaled a soft, satisfied sigh:</p>
<p>&quot;Salty‚Ä¶ but it tastes like the man I never want to lose.&quot;</p>
<p>Quan pulled her into his arms, holding her as if giving her every last piece of himself.</p>
<p>They melted into one another‚Äîno clocks, no storm, no outside world. Only two hearts, beating as one.</p>
<p>Tonight, her body had truly come alive. And that buried voice‚Ä¶ had finally been heard.</p>
